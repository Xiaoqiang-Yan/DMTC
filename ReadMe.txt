[Experiment Verification]
We give two plans to verify our proposed method:
[plan.1]Verify the DMTC with the trained parameters
   1.Run by inputing the command in terminal as follow:
   python run_eval.py

[plan.2]Perform the DMTC wholly
   1.Experimental requirements of both [A] and [B] should be fulfilled
   2.Run by inputing the command in terminal as follow:
   python run_DMTC.py
